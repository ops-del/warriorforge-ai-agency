# Luma Quick Reference - Copy/Paste Scripts

## 🎥 Video Scripts

### Script 1: "Meet Luma" (60 seconds)

```
This is Luma.

She's the AI we forged to turn your business into a 24/7 revenue machine.

While you sleep, Luma:
• Captures every lead that hits your page
• Asks the right qualifying questions
• Follows up instantly
• Books them on your calendar

No more missed leads. No more manual follow-up. No more "I'll get back to you."

Watch what happens when someone lands on our demo.

Try it yourself: warriorforgeai.com/demo/lead-capture

This is what your competitors are missing.
```

### Script 2: "24/7 Lead Machine" (45 seconds)

```
It's 2 AM. A lead hits your website.

Without AI: They leave. You lose.

With Luma: Instant response. Qualification. Follow-up. Booked call.

This is the difference between a 10% close rate and a 40% close rate.

Your best sales rep needs sleep. Luma doesn't.

Stop letting revenue walk away.
```

### Script 3: "The System" (90 seconds)

```
Here's what most businesses do with leads:

1. Lead comes in
2. You see it hours later
3. You respond
4. They ghost
5. You lose

Here's what WarriorForge does:

1. Lead lands on page
2. Luma responds in 30 seconds
3. Asks 3 qualifying questions
4. Books them on your calendar
5. You show up to a pre-sold appointment

This isn't theory. Watch it happen live.

[Demo the actual system]

Every business needs this. Most don't know it exists yet.

## 🎯 Objection Handlers

### "I need to think about it"

```
Totally fair. Here's what I recommend:

1. Try the demo yourself (3 minutes): warriorforgeai.com/demo/lead-capture
2. Think about how many leads you lose to slow response times
3. Calculate what 20-30% more booked calls would do for revenue

If it makes sense, we can map your exact funnel on a 15-min call.

If not, no worries. The demo is free value either way.
```

### "How much does it cost?"

```
Setup: $2,997
Monthly: $297

Here's the math:

If you close 1 extra client/month because of faster response times and better qualification, what's that worth?

Most businesses 3x their ROI in month 1.

Want to see if it fits your funnel? 15-min strategy call?
```

### "I'm already using [tool]"

```
Nice. What are you using for instant lead response + qualification + booking?

Most CRMs capture data. They don't qualify or book.

That's where Luma comes in. She sits on top of your existing stack and handles the human-like conversation part.

Try the demo: warriorforgeai.com/demo/lead-capture

You'll see the difference.
```

### "I don't have enough leads"

```
Perfect time to install this.

Here's why:

When you start running ads or SEO, you need a system to capture and convert those leads instantly.

Luma ensures that when the traffic comes, none of it leaks.

Plus, we can help you generate more leads through AI content + outreach.

Interested in the full stack?
